ManageMeTime
============

A small program to keep track of tasks, todo's and more importantly notifying. 
The system will accept main tasks, asks the user to branch out some of activities as sub-tasks and then nags! the user
untill the task is done. There are a lot of to-do/ task management applications out there but they miss (among others):
1- Motivating the people to do their tasks, i.e. people with ADGD or procrastinators.
2- Being flexible enough so that the user is able to easilty program his/her work at the begining of everyday and 
change the tasks as the time goes by.
